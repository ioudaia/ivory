						    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">November, I remember you vividly.</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">How you call down rain and thunder in front of me, whistling the cool breeze, recalling it as a symphony 
							that no conductor could ever create--the beginning of chaos that I was never prepared to be a part of. I didn't have time to open my umbrella at the time. 
							I looked like a drenched kitten in need of shelter, but since no one else was around and it was becoming late, why didn't I just get my umbrella?</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Oh, I forgot to bring my umbrella. It's become a habit. I'm losing track of my belongings, words to say, people 
							I hang out with, games I play, streets I stroll down, and even my identity. It's becoming challenging since every day feels like a new 
							life for me--the constant re-learning of things I already understood yesterday is still being taught to me today to ensure I don't 
							forget it. But every night, as I fall asleep, my memory resets on its own, and I forget everything to the point where I can't recognize 
							my bed.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">At moments like these, I feel like a tree beneath Autumn, with pieces of myself slowly falling to the ground 
							as I grow-- a sense of change with everything I'm a part of that's both intriguing and emotional. I discovered that in order to 
							progress, you must be willing to let go of some pieces of yourself. It is not about losing who you are but about letting go of 
							old beliefs that limit and impede your progress as you continue your path. Change is inevitable in all aspects of our lives; 
							it is also more stable than any other event we have witnessed. Understanding that life will always go on-- now is the time to 
							learn, strive, and grow in the life you've always wanted to live. So the next time I go out, I'll tie my umbrella to my hands.</p>
